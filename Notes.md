Today we will be focusing on making the base idea of the project and have the necessray tools. First lets look at our current hobbies:

* Hiking - there are various apps that already display hiking trails, and provide the basic info so whats the point of reinventing the wheel
* Marine Biology / zoology - This can open alot of different thigns as this is broad, we could have an application that helps zoologists in some way. 
* Fishing - Here is where we can find different typrs of apps as we have fish tournmanets, Inventory system, library of the different fish species which includes information of how to find, catch them, habitat, desciprition,  natural prey, and handling tips.
  


## Project #1:
Well after some time, it has come to my attention that the US tries to make endangered species an important topic hpowever we need to find a way toi make an interactive way to get children and young adults into learning more about these species

### Details 
So now that we have the idea #1: Endangered Species navigator

How to go forward with this:
1. We would like to cosntruct this in Python, we would like a visual web application that allows children, and young adults to see visual represnetations of these creatures with facts and news of these creatures.
   
2. As the topic of Endangered Species if one that tends to be covered alot through documentation, the best way to attract the attnetion towards the conservation is not through lectures but through interactive visuals similar to the concept of zoos. Think about it, Zoos convince many for conservation due to the phsycial appeal of said creatures so how about a way to amplify that aspect through a simialr approach with endagenred species on a virtual approah as these creatures are very few.

#### User Flow

* When the user enters the site they should easuly select an animal they wopuld like to learn about, we can have filters for example mammals, insects, birds, Aquatic
* There is no need for the user to log in to the site, as there is no benefit to do so. The main thing is for this web application to eeasily allow the user to click a box of the designated animal. By default it will be sorted by aphabeltical order
* The desing shoulkd be simple, one simple click should lead them to exactly where it is

#### Wire framing

          | Animal Page |

            /            \
   +----------------+   +-------------------+
   | Timeline       |   | Interactive      |
   |                |   | Display           |
   +----------------+   +-------------------+

#### Design System 

UI Desing joruney, we need to use a guideline for colors, fonts and icons (Realtime colors can help us with this process)

1. We need a color that represents Endangered species, and we need tp ensure the background, text. primary, secondary, accent, error, and success color to reflect the project
   
2. We need a consice and easy to read font for everyone, typescale can heelp with determining the font size and ratios. This is so we have Title, body and small text
    * title 32 px bold
    * Body 18px regular/Bold
    * small 14px regualr
   
3. icons which we can acquire friom figma
   
4. Input buttons, catgery inputs and website cards
   
#### Visual Approach

Lets start with the visual design of the application:
 * Visual hierarchy
 * Contrast
 * balance
 * Consistency
 * simplicity
 * Feedback
